                Big data is a pervasive problem, not a one-time occurrence. It is easy for most companies to realize that big data is problematic, but it is hard to identify what problems they have. Big data is all about the unknown, but the unknown cannot be off limits. IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench can help you learn about your data, make educated decisions with your most valuable asset, and turn your company's most dangerous risk into its most valuable asset.

                IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench is a data visualization and management tool that helps you to actively manage your company's data. It helps you to determine how much data you have, where it is, who owns it, and when it was last used. When you have a clear understanding of your company's data landscape, IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench helps you take control of data. You can make informed decisions about your data and act on that knowledge by copying, copying to retention, or conducting a discovery export.

Add 100 GB per TB of managed storage for full-text or snippet index. For example, to support 30 TB of storage that is indexed for metadata, you need 8 TB indexed for full-text search and extracted text (snippet cache) of 8 TB for auto-classification.
